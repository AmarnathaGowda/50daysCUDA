# Day 1: Introduction to CUDA

## 1. Overview & Objectives

### What I Learned Today:
Today was my first proper dive into CUDA, and honestly, at first, it felt a bit confusing but also exciting. While writing this note, I started connecting the dots, and it really opened my eyes. Before this, I used to think GPUs were just for gaming or AI model training, but I never really thought about **how** they process data so fast. Now, I understand that GPUs have this incredible ability to handle thousands of tasks at once, making them super powerful for all kinds of computing tasks. 

This learning experience gave me a strong foundation on what CUDA is, how it works, and why it's such a **big deal** in high-performance computing.

### Key Takeaways:
- **CUDA Defined:** Itâ€™s NVIDIAâ€™s parallel computing platform that lets GPUs do more than just graphics.
- **CPU vs. GPU:** CPUs handle tasks one by one, but GPUs can process many tasks at the same time, making them perfect for parallel computing.
- **CUDA Architecture:** The concept of **threads, blocks, and grids** makes it possible to run computations efficiently on GPUs.

## 2. What is CUDA?

I always thought of GPUs as just fancy hardware for gaming, but today I discovered CUDA â€“ **NVIDIAâ€™s Compute Unified Device Architecture**. Simply put, CUDA lets us use GPUs for general-purpose tasks beyond graphics.

### Why is this exciting?
- It enables **General-Purpose GPU (GPGPU) computing**, meaning GPUs can be used for AI, scientific simulations, and big data processing.
- CUDA is widely used in deep learning, real-time rendering, and high-performance computing.

## 3. GPU vs. CPU: Whatâ€™s the Difference?

Before today, I knew CPUs were used for general tasks, but now I understand why GPUs are **so much faster** for certain types of workloads.

### CPU (Central Processing Unit):
- **Good at:** Handling a few complex tasks at a time.
- **Cores:** Usually 4 to 16 powerful cores.
- **Best for:** Running operating systems, browsers, and general software.

### GPU (Graphics Processing Unit):
- **Good at:** Doing thousands of simple tasks **at the same time**.
- **Cores:** Thousands of smaller, efficient cores.
- **Best for:** AI training, video rendering, and physics simulations.

### The Big Takeaway:
If a task involves repeating the same operation across lots of data (like image processing or deep learning), a **GPU will be way faster** than a CPU.

## 4. CUDA Architecture: Breaking It Down

CUDA makes parallel computing easier by organizing execution in a structured way.

### Core Concepts:
- **Kernels:** Functions that run on the GPU and execute many times in parallel.
- **Threads, Blocks, and Grids:**
  - **Threads:** Smallest unit of execution.
  - **Blocks:** Groups of threads that work together.
  - **Grids:** Collections of blocks that manage large-scale parallel execution.

### Execution Model:
- CUDA programs run on the **CPU (host)** but execute kernels on the **GPU (device)**.
- The GPU processes data using a **hierarchical structure** of threads â†’ blocks â†’ grids.

### GPU Memory Hierarchy:
One of the coolest things I learned was how GPUs **manage memory efficiently**:
- **Global memory:** Accessible by all threads, but slow.
- **Shared memory:** Faster, used for communication between threads in a block.
- **Registers:** Super-fast but limited.
- **Constant memory:** Optimized for repeated access.

### **Why CUDA is Awesome:**
- CPUs struggle with massive workloads, but **GPUs thrive on them**.
- CUDA lets us **speed up computations massively** by using parallelism.

### **Where It's Used:**
- **AI & Machine Learning:** CUDA speeds up deep learning training in **TensorFlow and PyTorch**.
- **Gaming & Graphics:** Used for **real-time rendering and physics simulations**.
- **Scientific Computing:** Helps with complex **simulations and big data analysis**.
