# Day 20: Advanced Synchronization - CUDA Events

CUDA **events** allow precise **timing of kernel executions and data transfers**, enabling **performance analysis and synchronization**.

## 1. Overview & Objectives

### **Objective:**
Learn how to **create and use CUDA events** to:
- **Time kernel executions and memory transfers**.
- **Synchronize operations across streams**.
- **Measure execution latency** in CUDA applications.

### **Key Learning Outcomes:**
- Understand how to **record, synchronize, and measure CUDA events**.
- Learn to **time kernel execution and memory transfers accurately**.
- Use **events for profiling and performance tuning**.

### **Real-World Application:**
CUDA events are critical in **performance monitoring systems**, where **identifying bottlenecks** ensures **real-time responsiveness**.

## 2. Key Concepts

### **CUDA Events:**
- **Definition:** Markers that record timestamps at specific points in execution.
- **Usage:**
  - Created with `cudaEventCreate()`.
  - Recorded using `cudaEventRecord()`.
  - Synchronized with `cudaEventSynchronize()`.
  - **Elapsed time measured** using `cudaEventElapsedTime()`.

### **Synchronization with Events:**
- Events **ensure all preceding operations in a stream are complete** before moving forward.
- Useful for **timing kernel launches and memory transfers**.

### **Latency Measurement:**
- By placing events **before and after operations**, precise **execution times** can be obtained.
- Helps **identify bottlenecks** and optimize performance.

## 3. Code Example: Timing a Kernel Execution with CUDA Events

This example demonstrates:
- **Using CUDA events** to **measure kernel execution time**.
- **Synchronizing operations** for accurate measurement.

### **Code: `cudaEventsTiming.cu`**

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

// A simple kernel that performs a dummy computation on an array
__global__ void dummyKernel(float *d_data, int n) {
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (idx < n) {
        d_data[idx] = d_data[idx] * 2.0f + 1.0f;
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 1 << 20; // 1M elements
    size_t size = n * sizeof(float);
    float *d_data;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_data, size);

    cudaEvent_t start, stop;
    cudaEventCreate(&start);
    cudaEventCreate(&stop);

    cudaEventRecord(start, 0);

    int blockSize = 256;
    int gridSize = (n + blockSize - 1) / blockSize;
    dummyKernel<<<gridSize, blockSize>>>(d_data, n);

    cudaEventRecord(stop, 0);
    cudaEventSynchronize(stop);

    float elapsedTime;
    cudaEventElapsedTime(&elapsedTime, start, stop);
    printf("Kernel execution time: %f ms\n", elapsedTime);

    cudaEventDestroy(start);
    cudaEventDestroy(stop);
    cudaFree(d_data);

    return 0;
}
```

## Final Thoughts

CUDA **events** provide an efficient way to **profile and synchronize CUDA applications**. By precisely measuring **execution times**, developers can **identify performance bottlenecks and optimize workflows**.

For better optimization, **experiment with events, measure timings, and refine kernel execution** for maximum **efficiency**.
