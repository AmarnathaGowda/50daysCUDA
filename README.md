# ðŸš€ 50 Days of CUDA â€“ My Learning Journey ðŸŽ¯
I have started learning CUDA programming to understand GPU computing better. For the next 50 days, I will update this log daily with what I learn, key points, and useful links.

This is not just for tracking progress but also to understand GPU acceleration properly and apply it in real-world projects. Learning every day, little by little, makes a big difference!

If youâ€™re also into CUDA or GPU programming, feel free to follow along. Letâ€™s learn and grow together! ðŸ’»ðŸ”¥
