# 🚀 50 Days of CUDA – My Learning Journey 🎯
I have started learning CUDA programming to understand GPU computing better. For the next 50 days, I will update this log daily with what I learn, key points, and useful links.

This is not just for tracking progress but also to understand GPU acceleration properly and apply it in real-world projects. Learning every day, little by little, makes a big difference!

If you’re also into CUDA or GPU programming, feel free to follow along. Let’s learn and grow together! 💻🔥
